ðŸŽ“ I am currently an Associate AI Engineer at AI Singapore. I hold a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Data Science and Analytics from the National University of Singapore, with an exchange semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am passionate about 3D asset reconstruction, machine learning, and building robust AI systems for deployment. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!

ðŸ§  I specialise in applied AI, particularly in areas such as 3D reconstruction, computer vision, and cloud-based ML pipelines. I am constantly seeking self-improvement and enjoy keeping up with the latest developments in AI. Iâ€™m currently diving into the intricacies of large language models (LLMs), natural language processing, and building full-stack LLM projects and toy deployments. I believe in continuous learning and experimenting with new ideas to stay on the cutting edge of AI innovation. Letâ€™s connect!
